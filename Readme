*****Please do not commit any changes to the program

Developed a Series Solver using Python, the program can solve the following series:
multiplication,
exponential,
alternate multiplication,
alternate exponential,
fibonacci,
perfect squares ,
perfect cubes.

The program's flow is:
1) input length of series (atleast 6 digits)
2) input elements of series
3) program will check the series for common difference, common multiple, alternate multiplication, alternate exponential, fibo, perfect cubes/squares.
4) after analysing, input the number of elements you want the program to append to the series
5) program will run processess and return complete series in a list
6) if achieved result, program will exit
7) if not, user can re-enter parameters.

Do check out the code on github and feel free to let me know any errors or enhancements, Thanks!

Note: the length of the input series must be greater than or equal to 6
